# Flat Booking and Management Program

This program allows users to sign up, create a personal account, and log in using their credentials. Once logged in, users can choose their preferred area and select a desired flat (one at a time) for booking. The program retrieves flat data from the internal hardware located files named `common.txt` and `common1.txt`, and it uses the `user.txt` file to store user information.

# Requirements

To run the program, ensure you have the following components installed:

- [JDK 14.0.1](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/java-jdk/)
- [Eclipse Version 2020](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7143-eclipse-ide.html) (Recommended)

# Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the program:

- Extract the contents of `Java Project.rar` and place the folder in the `C:\` drive.
- Open the `Flat_Booking_Management` folder using a Java compiler. Then, run the `Login.java` file located in the `Flat_Booking_Management/src` folder (this will open the `Login` window).
- Follow the instructions provided in the opened window.

Additional file locations:
- `common.txt` and `common1.txt` files are located in the `Java Project/FamilySelection/` folder.
- `user.txt` file is located in the `Java Project/User txt/` folder.

# Caution

Please note the following instructions:

- Do not remove any files from the `Java Project` folder.
- Do not delete the `Java Project` folder from the `C:\` drive.
- Do not remove the `null null` entry from the `user.txt` file.

# Resetting

If you want to reset the program, follow these steps:

- Remove all content from the `user.txt` file, except for the `null null` entry. Place the cursor on the next line and save the file.
- Empty the `common.txt` file and re-enter the values `FLT1` to `10` in columns. Repeat the same process for the `common1.txt` file and enter `FLT1.1` to `10.1` in columns again.

# Common Bug

If, after entering the correct username and password in the Login window, it repeatedly shows the `Warning` window, simply reset the `user.txt` file by removing its content and placing the cursor on the next line. Additionally, reset the other `.txt` files if necessary.
